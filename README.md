<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](./img/Capture.jpg)

This project is a text editor built in WPF using C#. It contains a live character counter in the bottom left hand corner that changes whenever a character is added or removed. It supports reading and writing text files. The user may open a text file they already have, modify the contents, and save the file as a new text file or overwrite the original. The user may also create a new file in the program
and save it. The program will prompt the user to save changes upon exit if changes have not been saved.
